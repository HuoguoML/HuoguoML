# HuoguoML 
HuoguoML is a framework for managing machine learning models. It provides a set of lightweight APIs that can be used with all existing machine learning applications. Current core features are:

- HuoguoML Tracking: An API to log parameters, code, and results in machine learning experiments 
- HuoguoML Dashboard: A dashboard that displays experiments and their associated artifacts
- HuoguoML Service: A CLI to easily launch a machine learning microservice from your logged experiments
